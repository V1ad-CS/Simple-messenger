1. **Importing the Socket Library**

```python
import socket
```

- This line imports Python’s built-in `socket` module, which allows for network communication by creating and managing sockets.

2. **Defining the Main Function (`mp()`)**

The function `mp()` is the core of the program. It starts by asking the user to choose between two actions: `"send"` or `"receive"`.

```python
def mp():
    choose = input('select an action (send/receive): ')
```

- The user’s input determines the branch of execution within the function.

3. **The Receiving Branch**

If the user selects **receive**:

```python
if choose == 'receive':
    port = input('Enter port: ')
    soc = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    soc.bind(('', int(port)))
    soc.listen(1)

    print('waiting connection...')
```

- **Port Input:** The program prompts the user to enter a port number.
- **Socket Creation:** It creates a TCP socket (`AF_INET` for IPv4, `SOCK_STREAM` for TCP).
- **Binding:** It binds the socket to all available network interfaces (empty string means all interfaces) on the provided port.
- **Listening:** The call to `listen(1)` prepares the socket to accept incoming connections, with a backlog of 1 connection.
- **Waiting:** A message is printed to indicate that the program is waiting for an incoming connection.

Once a connection is established:

```python
while True:
    con, addr = soc.accept()
    print("Connected clinet :" , con)
    try:
        filename = con.recv(1024)
        with open(filename, 'wb') as file:
            while True:
                recvfile = con.recv(1024)
                if recvfile: 
                    file.write(recvfile)
                    break
    except IOError:
        m = filename.decode()
        print(m)
        break
print('File or text has been received.')
```

- **Accepting Connections:** The `accept()` method waits until a client connects, returning a new socket (`con`) for that connection and the client’s address (`addr`).
- **Receiving Filename/Text:** The first data received (up to 1024 bytes) is assumed to be the filename.  
  - *Note:* If a file is being transferred, this first chunk typically contains the filename. If it’s not actually a filename (for instance, when sending text), an error might occur.
- **Writing Received Data:**
  - The program opens a file with the received name in binary write mode.
  - It then enters another loop with `recv(1024)` to get file data. However, it writes only one chunk (it breaks out of the loop after writing one chunk), which might be insufficient for files larger than 1024 bytes.
- **Error Handling:**
  - If an `IOError` occurs (likely due to trying to open a file with an invalid filename), the code interprets the received data as text. It decodes the filename (which now holds a text message) and prints it.
  - The loop is then broken.
- **Completion Message:** After finishing the transfer, it prints that the file or text has been received.

4. **The Sending Branch**

If the user selects **send**:

```python
elif choose == 'send': 
    filename = input('enter file name (with extension) or text: ')
    address = input('Enter IP-address (X.X.X.X): ')
    port = input('Enter port: ')

    soc = socket.socket()
    soc.connect((str(address), int(port)))
```

- **User Inputs:**
  - The program asks for the filename or text to send.
  - It also asks for the receiver’s IP address and port.
- **Socket Connection:**
  - A new TCP socket is created (default parameters create an IPv4 socket using TCP).
  - The program attempts to connect to the specified receiver using the provided IP and port.

Next, inside a `try` block:

```python
try:
    f = open(filename)
    with open(filename, 'rb') as file:
        soc.sendall(bytes(filename, 'UTF-8'))
        sendfile = file.read()
        soc.sendall(sendfile)
    print('file sent')
except IOError:
    soc.sendall(bytes(filename, 'UTF-8'))
```

- **File Transfer Attempt:**
  - The program first tries to open the input as a file.
  - If successful, it sends the filename encoded in UTF-8 over the socket.
  - Then, it reads the complete content of the file and sends it over the connection.
  - A success message ("file sent") is printed.
- **Fallback for Non-File Text:**
  - If opening the file fails (triggering an `IOError`), the input is assumed to be plain text rather than a filename.
  - The program then sends just the text (by encoding it to UTF-8).

5. **Handling an Invalid Action**

If the user enters something other than `"send"` or `"receive"`:

```python
else:
    print("Houston, we're in trouble...")
```

- A message is printed to indicate that the action is not recognized.

6. **Running and Continuing the Program**

After defining the function, the program calls `mp()` once:

```python
mp()
```

Then, it enters an infinite loop allowing the user to perform more actions:

```python
while True:
    cont = input('Continue (y/n)? ')
    if cont == 'y':
        mp()
    if cont == 'n':
        print('Bye')
```

- **Continuation Prompt:** The user is asked whether they want to continue.
- **Loop Behavior:**
  - If the user inputs `'y'`, the `mp()` function is executed again.
  - If the user inputs `'n'`, the program prints "Bye".  
    - *Note:* Although "Bye" is printed, the loop does not include a `break`, so even if `'n'` is entered, the program will keep prompting. This seems to be an oversight in the code.

Summary

- **Purpose:** The code is a simple socket-based file/text sender and receiver.
- **Send Mode:** Tries to send a file (first sending the filename, then the file content) or sends plain text if the file cannot be opened.
- **Receive Mode:** Listens on a specified port, accepts a connection, and then expects to receive a filename followed by file data (or text). It writes the data to a file or prints it if an error occurs.
- **Looping:** After one round of sending/receiving, it asks if the user wants to continue.
